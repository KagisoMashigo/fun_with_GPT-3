# Application Details

An application that uses the GPT-3 AI model created by [OpenA.I.](https://openai.com/api/). The model can process plain text prompts and produce outputs based on what the model has been trained to do.

In this application, users can type in a prompt (e.g. Write a story about Beavers, I think dogs are overrated, etc.) in the form. Once a prompt is submitted, depending on the engine you have selected to use, the GPT-3 mdoel contacted and respond with an output accordingly.
